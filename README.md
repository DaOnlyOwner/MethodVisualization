# IoTvizium: Interactive Web-based Visualization for IoT Ontology Concept Clustering

## Overview
This toolchain provides a user-friendly interactive web application visualization tool for 
exploring IoT ontology concept clustering results.
IoTvizium encodes the visualization with three aspects (concept color, concept size, and semantic distance) and incorporates three visualization methods (wordclouds, bounding circle and bounding box).

## Requirements
- Python 3.9.0
- for python requirements see requirements.txt
